# Weatherman

A display that will live next to my front door and display the current weather
conditions. Components:

* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
* [Waveshare 3.7" e-Paper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/3.7inch-e-paper-hat.htm)

As part of this project, I'm also working on a Rust interface for the Waveshare
display, which I'll spin off into a separate crate when it's done.
